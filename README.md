## Linear Regression to Predict MPG:
This is a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression, and it address the following questions:

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

From the above output we can see that:

1. The vehicle length, and vehicle ground clearance are statistically likely to provide non-random amounts of variance to the model. That is to say, the vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance have a significant impact on miles per gallon on the MechaCar prototype. Conversely, the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and All Wheel Drive (AWD) have p-Values that indicate a random amount of variance with the dataset.

2. The p-Value for this model, p-Value: 5.35e-11, is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. This indicates there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which further indcates that the slope of this linear model is not zero.

3. This linear model has an r-squared value of 0.7149, which means that approximately 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model. Relatively speaking, his multiple regression model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
